# Expression-Evaluator

#### Course Project for the subject - Compiler Design

A web application which takes a mathematical expression written in English
and evaluates it.
The evaluation follows the below steps:
1) lexical analysis and tokenization
2) creating a parse tree
3) creating an abstract syntax tree
4) Code Generation
5) evaluating the code

Eg. (add 2 3) 
*This evaluates to 5*
